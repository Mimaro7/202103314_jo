Dillinger is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage compatible  
Angular JS-powered HTML5 Markdown editor.


* Type some Markdown on the left
* See HTML in the right
* ✨Magic✨


## Features

* Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
* Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)
* Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
* Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
* Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions  
that people naturally use in email.  
As [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber) writes on the [Markdown site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)  

```python
for i in range(10):
 print(hello)
```


> *The overriding design goal for Markdown’s*  
> *formatting syntax is to make it as readable*  
> *as possible. The idea is that a*  
> *Markdown-formatted document should be*  
> *publishable as-is, as plain text, without*  
> *looking like it’s been marked up with tags*  
> *or formatting instructions.*  

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel  
for Markdown’s syntax, type some text into the left window and  
watch the results in the right.  

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Twitter Bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)) - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Express) - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk](https://github.com/tj)
- [Gulp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallowing) - the streaming build system
- [Breakdance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing) - HTML
